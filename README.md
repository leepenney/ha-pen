HA-Pen
========

This is a simple home automation setup that uses the [Pi-Mote](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI) from Energnie to allow the control of power sockets based on timers set by you.

Features
--------
            
- Web interface
- Control multiple sockets
- Set multiple timers for each socket to control on and off times
- Allow you to set the timers to come on or go off based on sunrise and sunset
            
Installation
------------
            
Getting everything installed and working is a little convuluted, but simple enough, see the docs for full details.            

Todo
----

Some areas that need adding or improving are:

- Allow offset for sunrise and sunset times (i.e. come on at 30 minutes before sunset)
- Better support for a range of display sizes
- Extend the code to support monitoring of ambient light to control on/off times
